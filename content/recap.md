# **Recap**

## This workshop covered:
* what *dplyr* package is used for,
* how to manipulate rows and columns, 
* and how to combine multiple manipulations.   

Now you are equipped to do basic data manipulation tasks in R with *dplyr*.  

## Topics for further learning:
* the comparison of the functions from *dplyr* package and similar functions from the base R package, such as some shown in [STAT 545](https://stat545.com/dplyr-intro.html#use-filter-to-subset-data-row-wise:~:text=Compare%20with%20some%20base%20R%20code%20to%20accomplish%20the%20same%20things%3A),
* optional arguments in each function that help control certain features,
* various kinds of functions to use with `mutate()` and `summarise()`, such as some shown in the [*dplyr* Cheat Sheet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/main/data-transformation.pdf),
* manipulate multiple variables at once, such as some shown in the *dplyr* Cheat Sheet.


Practice and use additional resources to build your skill to the next level. You can also attend other workshops or book a consultation with the research commons.

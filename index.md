# Welcome to Data Manipulation with *dplyr*

Data manipulation is a crucial part of data visualization and analysis. This workshop introduces common functions in the *dplyr* package to manipulate rows and  columns.  
See the UBC library Research Commons [event calendar](https://researchcommons.library.ubc.ca/events/) for related workshops on various topics.  

Prerequisites
{: .label .label-yellow}
> This workshop assumes a basic understanding of R language, but all learners are welcome to participate.  
Participants are expected to have installed the latest versions of R and RStudio on their computers before the workshop:  
Install R from [https://cran.rstudio.com/](https://cran.rstudio.com/)   
Install RStudio from [https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)  

Please note that while we go through many examples during the workshop, we do not cover all of the operations available in dplyr. 

## Learning objectives

At the end of this workshop, you will be able to:
1. Understand what the *dplyr* package is used for
2. Use pipe operator to combine multiple manipulations together
3. Manipulate rows to select, arrange, and add cases
4. Manipulate columns to select, arrange, add, and rename variables
